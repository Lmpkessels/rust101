# Rust101

Rust101 is my public sandbox for learning Rust and foundational computer science.
I use it to test ideas, break things, and think out loud.
If it looks messy — good. That’s how I learn.

## 📦 Requirements

- Rust Toolchain
- Basic terminal knowledge
- (Optional) VS Code + rust-analyzer

## 📚 What You'll Learn

Rust syntax & ownership

Memory & pointers

Logic gates, arithmetic, and bit-level operations

Data structures (linked lists, trees)

CPU, stack, heap, concurrency basics

## 🧠 Study Method

Write by hand

Solve each problem from scratch

Refactor for clarity

Document what you learn in comments or in NOTES.md
